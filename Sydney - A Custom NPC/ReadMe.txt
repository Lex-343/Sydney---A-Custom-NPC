Hello, and thank you for choosing to download my mod! It's a labor of love
For those unfamiliar with SDV modding, getting my mod to work is as simple as 4 easy steps
-Download and install the latest version of SMAPI following its instructions
-Download and install the latest version of Content Patcher following its instructions
-Drag my mod into the "mods" folder of your SDV main directory, if you for some reason don't have one, just create a new folder there and label it as "mods"
-Launch SDV with SMAPI 

Additonally, SMAPI will tell you when I've updated this mod! Or alert you to any nasty errors. Be sure to thank PathosChild for all of his hard work.

If you have any questions or issues with my mod feel free to ping me at the SDV discord @Lex in #modded-game-support or #making-mods depending on your issue/question. Otherwise, bug reports can be filed on my mod page.
